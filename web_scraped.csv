Got these for my father who was using cheap trainers that were hurting his feet.He uses these for running indoor/outdoors and walking. They are great on his feet, he doesn't have any off the issues wich he had when using the cheap brand trainers.Definitely would recommend these.Great price, comfortable and look great.

Scarpe che mi hanno dato un senso di benessere e di controllo di camminata.Ho diversi problemi di deambulazione e cercavo una scarpa che potessi indossare con un tutore.PRO:-Leggerezza- Morbidezza della tomaia- Imbottitura del collo caviglia e della linguetta- suola rimovibile in caso di inserimento plantare- pur essendo una scarpa sportiva il nero conferisce uno stile elegante- facile da indossare- lacci belli sicuri.CONTRO:-Scivolosa in caso di pioggia-Facile da sporcareIn realtà, essendo molto leggere, non sono indicate per il clima freddo ma hanno una buona solidità e nel mio caso le indosso con piacere anche d'inverno perchè stabili e capaci di garantire sicurezza e comodità.Spero di aiutare chi come me è alla ricerca di un prodotto che metta sicurezza e tranquillità a chi ha difficoltà a camminare.

Por el precio mucho mejor de lo que podría esperar.No las puedo comparar con mis Pegasus 36, pero el precio tampoco es comparable.Volvería a comprar sin duda

La calzata è comoda e ammortizzata, direi perfette per camminata veloce o jogging leggero, non le azzarderei per corsa giornaliera, credo ci siano prodotti più prestanti. Scarpa molto traspirabile quindi il piede non suda, ma se fuori c'è freddo lo sentite entrare nel piede, per cui a vostra discrezione se vi piace tenere le zeppe al fresco...

Regalate al mio fidanzato (non è la prima volta). Comodissime come sempre e linea top.

passt perfekt:habe die schuhe erst etwas kleiner bestellt, da ich mich an der angegebenen größentabelle orientiert habe.trage für gewöhnlich die größe 10,5. hier passt mir die 11 perfekt.gönnt euch - preis Leistung geht klar

Son comodos, pueden ser usados diario y no cansan, al contrario, ayudan a descansar los pies.

I regularly do brisk walking. Its light weight shoes and also available in my UK Size 7.The sole gets wear out by regular walk but overall Shoe material, Lace, Fitting, Finishing, Grip on ankle and fit is A1 Quality. Its washable and look like new after wash. Even use in Rainy Season as well.Is there any way to stick NEW SOLE if it get wear out early!!! Please reply if any one knows!!!
"

Good things first. Good shoes, although a bit expensive. The grip of the sole is good. Noticed very good grip when I walk quickly/run on slippery surfaces like wet tiles. The fit for my feet is also good. The cushioning while walking is good.Now the not so good parts. Bought it during a sale under discount and 2-3 months later found the similar product(different color nike symbol) being sold at a price which was much lower than the reduced sale price I got. The sole of the product was heavily discolored (patchy) as shown in attached image. Although this discoloration doesn't affect performance, it sure makes us feel disappointed for being sold rejected pieces.Would have rated it a 2.5 if option was available. This rating is to do with the appearance and the price(even after sale discount!!) rather than its performance.

Feels very comfortable and very sturdy. I am still using it as a backup.

shoes build quality is good. its light weight and agile for waling, running, etc.

These shoes are amazing for running, jogging and exercising, surprisingly better than Nike renew Run or Nike revolution 5. These are a value of money and their design is superb for running. Don't be in doubt about it because of its cheap price, they definitely mean what they are named for.
